## Application Structure

- `/src/components`: Reusable UI components
- `/src/pages`: Main application pages
- `/src/context`: State management using Context API
- `/src/data`: Mock data to simulate backend functionality

## Available Pages

- **Home** (`/`): Dashboard with trending topics, latest posts, and recommended connections
- **Posts** (`/posts`): View and create posts, filter by different categories
- **Profile** (`/profile`): View and manage your professional profile
- **Chats** (`/chats`): Join and participate in group discussions

## State Management

The application uses React's Context API for state management. The main contexts are:

- `AppContext`: Manages global app state including user data, posts, and chats

## Mock Backend

Since this is a frontend-only MVP, we use mock data to simulate backend functionality. In a production environment, these would be replaced with actual API calls.

## Future Enhancements

- Authentication system
- Real-time messaging with WebSockets
- Advanced search and filtering
- Notifications system
- Mobile application
